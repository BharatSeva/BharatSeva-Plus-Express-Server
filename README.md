> [!TIP]
> Hi everyone! Hope you're doing well, this is to let you know that you can access webapps hosted on public links:   
> - [User Interface](https://github.com/BharatSeva/BharatSeva-Plus-User-Interface)  
> - [HealthCare Interface](https://github.com/BharatSeva/BharatSeva-Plus-HealthCare-Interface)  

## Target : Scale this Server for Massive 50 Million Users 🚀
### Upcoming Features:
- **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** Ensures the application can process tasks asynchronously.  
- **Redis** Caching frequently accessed data
- **NGINX** Traffic Management and Load balancing
- **Golang** Server for optimized performance, scalability, and concurrency
- **PostgreSQL** To handle advance querying, and to perform large data analytics.
- **Prometheus and Grafana** To collect and stores metric data as time-series data, and for analytics and visualization of Express application.

### Future Plans:
- Transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices
- Continuously improve code quality to ensure long-term maintainability

## Installation

--- 
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local (default port) or cloud instance)
- Firebase account for configuration (Create your Firebase Account and database in few steps )  
    	- Create [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com/)  
    	- Create Project, add Firebase database, go to settings of project and look of configurations  
    	- Copy all these configurations for your setup.  
- Postman in your local system
- Docker (this is Optional, if you want to contribute to UI only them setting up container will help you to test your application.) 
### Steps
1. Fork the repository, clone the repo in your local system using

    ```
       git clone http://<your-repo-url>/.git .
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    - Run command  
      ```
        npm i
      ```
    - Setup .env file in root directory with following variables
      
     ```
        MONGODB_URL=<your-cluster-url-goes-here>  # set this only rest are not necessary
        JWT_SECRET_KEY=JWT_SECRET_KEY
        Patient_JWT_SECRET_KEY=30d
        SENDEREMAIL=SENDEREMAIL             # optional
        SENDERPASSWORD=SENDERPASSWORD       # optional
        JWT_LIFETIME=30d
        Patient_JWT_LIFETIME=Patient_JWT_LIFETIME
        Patient_JWT_SECRET_KEY=30d
        PORT=5000
     ```
    - Setup Firebase project and app, you'll be get following config keys in project setting
   
     ```
       apiKey=<apiKey>
       authDomain=<authDomain>
       projectId=<projectId>
       storageBucket=<storageBucket>
       messagingSenderId=<messagingSenderId>
       appId=<appId>
       measurementId=<measurementId>
     ```

4. Run the server:
     ```
       npm start
     ```

6. Alternately you can setup docker-compose file and use following command to start your container, make sure you've added all the required env variables.
    ```
       docker-compose up -d
    ```

8. Go to ```http://localhost:5000/``` for user dashboard, and ```http://localhost:5000/healthcare/``` for Healthcare dashboard.

9. This project consist of two webapps User( also Referred as Patient) and Healthcare dashboard.
    - If you're first time user you first need to create your healthcare account via Postman api collection with ```Register Healthcare``` endpoint in``` HealthCare_endpoints``` folder or you can use UI dashboard by hitting ```http://localhost:5000/healthcare/``` url in your favourite browser.
    - After your Healthcare account created, you can create User Biodata with ```Create User Bio Data (HealthCare)``` enpoint, which user can register and login themselves inorder to use platform.
    - Now, you can use ```Register User``` and ```Login User``` endpoint to verify and create your user account.
    - Refer to Postman Collection, if you've any doubt in endpoints or if you thing there's feature you can add, feel free to raise issue.
    - You can start discussion about specific topic for your doubt.
